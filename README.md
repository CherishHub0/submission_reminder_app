# Submission Reminder App

How to run the app:

1. First, run `./create_environment.sh` to set up all the folders and files.
2. Then, run `./copilot_shell_script.sh` to change the assignment name and check who didnâ€™t submit.
3. Finally, run `./startup.sh` to start the reminder app.

Notes:

- Make sure you run the commands in the right folder.
- I added some extra students in the submissions file for testing.
- If you get errors, check your file locations and permission.
